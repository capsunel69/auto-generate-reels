# Subtitle System Improvements

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive improvements made to the subtitle system to address timing issues and provide clean, readable subtitles without distracting highlighting effects.

## Problems Addressed

### 1. **Language-Specific Recognition Issues**
- **Problem**: Speech recognition was hardcoded to Romanian (`"ro-RO"`)
- **Solution**: Added language parameter support with automatic language code mapping
- **Impact**: Better recognition accuracy for both Romanian and English content

### 2. **Word Alignment Inaccuracies**
- **Problem**: Simple fuzzy matching led to misaligned words and incorrect timing
- **Solution**: Implemented advanced sequence matching with confidence scoring
- **Impact**: More accurate word-to-timing alignment, especially for complex words

### 3. **Timing Synchronization Issues**
- **Problem**: Multiple timing buffers accumulated errors, causing sync drift and words appearing during pauses
- **Solution**: Reduced timing buffers, improved precision, and better pause detection
- **Impact**: More precise synchronization with words appearing exactly when spoken

### 4. **Distracting Word Highlighting**
- **Problem**: Word-by-word highlighting was distracting and sometimes inaccurate
- **Solution**: Removed all highlighting effects for clean, readable subtitles
- **Impact**: Better viewing experience with focus on content rather than effects

### 5. **Punctuation Handling Issues**
- **Problem**: Important punctuation like apostrophes were being removed (e.g., "you're" became "youre")
- **Solution**: Fixed regex to preserve apostrophes and hyphens while removing other punctuation
- **Impact**: Perfect preservation of contractions and hyphenated words

## Technical Improvements

### 1. Enhanced Speech Recognition (`get_word_timestamps_from_google`)

```python
# Before: Hardcoded Romanian
language_code="ro-RO"

# After: Dynamic language support
language_map = {
    "romanian": "ro-RO",
    "english": "en-US"
}
language_code = language_map.get(language.lower(), "ro-RO")
```

**Additional improvements:**
- Enhanced model selection (`latest_long` vs `latest_short`)
- Automatic punctuation detection
- Confidence score tracking
- Better error handling

### 2. Improved Word Alignment (`align_texts`)

**Before:** Simple word-by-word matching with basic similarity
**After:** Advanced sequence matching with:
- Confidence-based alignment scoring
- Better normalization (preserves hyphens, apostrophes)
- Overlap detection and correction
- Estimated timing for unmatched words
- Post-processing to smooth timing gaps

### 3. Clean Subtitle Creation (`create_subtitle_clips`)

**Key improvements:**
- **No highlighting**: Removed all word-by-word highlighting for cleaner viewing
- **Perfect punctuation handling**: Preserves apostrophes (') and hyphens (-), removes ,.!?;:()[]{}
- **Precise timing**: Minimal buffers (20ms) and better synchronization
- **Adaptive grouping**: 2-3 words based on confidence and natural breaks
- **Pause-aware timing**: Respects natural pauses, prevents words appearing during silence

### 4. Enhanced Word Cleaning - FIXED

**Before:**
```python
# Incorrectly removed apostrophes along with quotes
word = re.sub(r'[„""\'"]', '', word)
# Result: "you're" → "youre", "well-known" → "wellknown"
```

**After:**
```python
# Preserve apostrophes, remove only quotes
word = re.sub(r'[„"""]', '', word)  # Removed \' from regex
word = word.strip(',.;:!?()[]{}')
allowed_chars = r'\w\'\-șțăîâŞŢĂÎÂ'
word = re.sub(f'[^{allowed_chars}]', '', word)
# Result: "you're" → "YOU'RE", "well-known" → "WELL-KNOWN"
```

## Configuration Changes

### Timing Parameters - IMPROVED FOR PRECISION
```python
# Old values → New values (for better precision)
TIMING_BUFFER = 0.05 → 0.02  # 20ms for precise timing
GROUP_TRANSITION_GAP = 0.08 → 0.05  # 50ms between groups
SUB_TIMING_BUFFER = 0.05 → 0.02  # 20ms subtitle buffer
PAUSE_DETECTION = 0.25 → 0.4  # 400ms for stricter pause detection
```

### Grouping Logic - MORE CONSERVATIVE
```python
# Smaller groups for better timing precision
max_group_size = 3 if confidence > 0.8 else 2  # Reduced from 4/3
# Break immediately for estimated words
(is_estimated and len(current_group) >= 1)  # Was >= 2
```

### Subtitle Styling
```python
# Removed highlighting styles completely
# Before: Two styles (Default + Highlight)
# After: Single clean style (Default only)

# Clean, readable styling
Style: Default,{font_name},64,&H00FFFFFF,&H000000FF,&H00000000,&H80000000,-1,0,0,0,100,100,1,0,1,4,0,2,400,400,30,1
```

### Word Processing - FIXED
```python
# Fixed punctuation handling
def clean_word_for_display(word):
    word = word.upper()
    word = re.sub(r'[„"""]', '', word)  # Remove quotes, keep apostrophes
    word = word.strip(',.;:!?()[]{}')     # Remove punctuation from edges
    allowed_chars = r'\w\'\-șțăîâŞŢĂÎÂ'  # Keep apostrophes and hyphens
    word = re.sub(f'[^{allowed_chars}]', '', word)
    return word.strip()
```

## Performance Improvements

## Recent Fixes (Latest Update)

### Apostrophe Preservation Issue - RESOLVED ✅
- **Problem**: "you're" was becoming "youre" due to regex removing apostrophes
- **Root Cause**: Apostrophes were included in quote removal regex: `[„""\'"]`
- **Solution**: Separated quote removal from apostrophe preservation: `[„"""]`
- **Result**: Perfect preservation of contractions like "you're", "don't", "it's"

### Timing Precision Issue - RESOLVED ✅
- **Problem**: Words appearing during pauses instead of when actually spoken
- **Root Cause**: Aggressive timing buffers and loose pause detection
- **Solution**: 
  - Reduced timing buffer: 50ms → 20ms
  - Stricter pause detection: 250ms → 400ms
  - Conservative grouping: max 3 words instead of 4
  - Precise timing without artificial extensions
- **Result**: Words appear exactly when spoken, respecting natural pauses

## Future Enhancements

Potential areas for further improvement:
- Support for additional languages (Spanish, French, etc.)
- User-configurable subtitle styling options
- Advanced punctuation-aware grouping
- Real-time subtitle preview during creation

## Backward Compatibility

All improvements maintain backward compatibility:
- Existing API endpoints work unchanged
- Default language remains Romanian
- Fallback mechanisms for missing confidence data
- Graceful degradation for older subtitle files
